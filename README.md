Hello, welcome to Events API


User Story: As an event organizer, I want to create and manage events through a web platform. I should be able to:

Register and log in to the platform (I should get a welcome mail when I register).
Create new events with details such as name, date, location, description.
Manage attendees by adding, editing and removing attendees from the event (attendees should get a mail when they are added to or removed from an event).
Generate reports for each event with information about attendee count etc.


The Events API caters for the user demands as described above, see the API documention for how to use the API.
